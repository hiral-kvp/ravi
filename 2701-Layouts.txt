Layouts Pages in MVC app
------------------------

Layouts are generally saved into ~/Views/Shared (or /AreaName/Views/Shared) and they are marked as hidden using _ underscore prefix.
For example,

/Views/Shared/_Site.cshtml
---------------------------
<!doctype html>
<head><title>@ViewBag.Title</title></head>  
<body>
  <h1>Site Name</h1>
  <nav><a href="/home/index">Home</a><a href="/home/login">Login</a></nav>
  <section>@RenderBody()</section>
</body>

and apply this layout page to content pages.
e.g
/Views/Home/Index.cshtml
@{ Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_Site.cshtml"; }
<h3>Welcome Home</h3>
