You can download Bootstrap from www.getbootstrap.com or nuget.org. In Visual Studio, the boostrap code is exist under demo templates of Web Applications and also use "Scafolding" -- Create a view with [x] checking the Layout page in MVC project.

To bootstrap  a web document (.cshtml - simple or loayout)
------------------------------------------------------------

1. First of we've three folders in our apps that contains CSS Framework files/programs.

/Content
    -> Bootstrap.css
    -> Bootstrap.min.css
    -> Site.css <-- It is for users

/Fonts
    Font files to represent icons

/Scripts
    -> jquery-x-x.js and
    -> jquery-x-min.js
    -> bootstrap.js and
    -> bootstrap.min.js

2. 

In <head> of a doc, set "viewport' <meta> to layout for mobile as well as regular devices.

Then, <link > the /Content/Bootstrap.min.css and after it 
      <link> your own css docs (e.g. style.css or site.css etc)

At the end of </body> and just before it, embed .js in following order:

   <script src="/Scripts/jquery-x-x.min.js"></script>
   <script src="/Scripts/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
   <script>
      //code
   </script>

3. Use "Grid" system to place the elements, text, content, images, videos, etc --- A "grid" in bootstrap is a row and it has 12 equal width columns for different sizes of screen:

  col-lg-x ( x means value between 1 to 12) - for large device - laptop
  col-md-x  for medium (PC)
  col-sm-x  for small device (tablets phones)
  col-xs-x for extreen small screen

4. Use "container" selector which wraps the content of entire web page:
