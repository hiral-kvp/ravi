 The Solution -- Multiple projects
 ========================================================================
 When we creates a project, our project will be added into a solution by default. A  solution (.sln file) is a group project file which contains one or more projects, so  we can work on more than one projects at a time.

 The solution file helps us to compile all these projects at onces, close or open  these projects at onces and also add references of one project to another project.

 Steps to create multi project environment
 -------------------------------------------

 1. File + New + Project + Other Project Types + Visual Studio Solutions + Blank     Solution + Name your solution e.g MultiApp and press OK.

 2. Once a solution is created, use File + Add + New Project to add one or more     projects into currently created solution.
